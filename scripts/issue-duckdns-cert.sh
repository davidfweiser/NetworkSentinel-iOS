# Issue a free Let's Encrypt certificate for a duckdns.org hostname and install it

#
# DNS-01 is used rather than HTTP-01: it proves control by writing a TXT record
# through the DuckDNS API, so nothing has to be reachable on port 80.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/issue-duckdns-cert.sh                       # prompts for anything missing
#   ./scripts/issue-duckdns-cert.sh myhost                # subdomain as an argument
#   DuckDNS_Token=xxxx ./scripts/issue-duckdns-cert.sh myhost
#
# Non-interactive (this is how the app's "Issue certificate" button runs it — there is
# no terminal to answer prompts on, so anything missing is an error, not a read):
#   NS_ASSUME_YES=1 NS_ACME_EMAIL=you@example.com ./scripts/issue-duckdns-cert.sh myhost
#
# Renewal: acme.sh installs its own cron entry. The console re-reads the files when
# they change, so a renewal applies without restarting it.
