/// <summary>
/// Watches how this machine — and anything it forwards for — resolves names.
///
/// DNS is where a compromise usually shows first: almost nothing connects without
/// resolving a name, and DNS itself is a standard exfiltration channel that the
/// exfiltration monitor cannot see (it counts TCP socket bytes; DNS is UDP). Until
/// now this app had no view of DNS at all.
///
/// It also closes a specific hole in this app's own defences. AllowlistService
/// resolves allowlisted domains over whatever DNS the host is using, and
/// PreventionService will never auto-block a resolved allowlist address. Poison the
/// host's DNS and an attacker's address is written into the allowlist under a
/// trusted domain's name, permanently immune to blocking. Resolution drift is
/// detected here for exactly that reason.
///
/// What it can and cannot see:
///   - port 53 is plaintext DNS, and is detected wherever it goes
///   - port 853 is DoT, and is recognised as encrypted
///   - DoH is HTTPS on 443 and is indistinguishable from ordinary web traffic. It is
///     only counted as encrypted DNS when the destination is a resolver you listed
///     in <see cref="ApprovedResolvers"/>. Without that list, a DoH setup looks like
///     no DNS at all rather than like a leak.
///
/// Flows arrive from the PF state-table source, so this covers traffic the socket
/// tables never show — including DNS forwarded on behalf of VPN clients. That needs
/// PF enabled and root; without either the status says so and no detection runs.
/// Because that source polls rather than receiving kernel events, a query that opens
/// and closes inside one interval can be missed — repeated queries to the same
/// resolver, which is what every check here keys on, are seen reliably.
